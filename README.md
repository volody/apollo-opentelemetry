As we get older, our perception of time accelerates for both physiological and psychological reasons. On a biological level, the brain’s processing speed slows as the networks of neurons grow more complex, so we literally take in fewer “frames” of information every second—like a flipbook with fewer pages. Meanwhile, each passing year represents a smaller fraction of our overall life, so it feels briefer compared to when we were children.

Another key factor is novelty. When we’re young, nearly everything we encounter is new, so our minds register an abundance of memorable moments. As adults, we tend to settle into routines and have fewer unfamiliar experiences to make time feel rich and distinct. This lack of novelty can make weeks, months, and years blur together, giving the impression that time is speeding up.

To counteract this, experts suggest deliberately seeking out the new—experimenting with unfamiliar foods or hobbies, taking different routes for daily errands, and staying open to surprises. Being “mindfully present” also helps: by truly engaging in the current moment instead of replaying the past or worrying about the future, we sharpen our awareness and effectively slow our experience of time.
